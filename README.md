# Alternative Routes in Road Networks

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **alternative route computation in road networks**, helping in efficient pathfinding for **navigation, traffic management, and logistics**. The program identifies **multiple viable routes** between a source and a destination, allowing users to choose the best option based on different criteria.

## ✨ Features
- 🛣️ **Computes alternative paths** instead of a single shortest route.  
- 🚀 **Dijkstra’s Algorithm / A* Search** for pathfinding.  
- 🔄 **Diversified routes** to avoid similar paths.  
- 📊 **Supports weighted graphs** with cost factors (time, distance, congestion, etc.).  
- 🖥️ **Visualization (Optional)**: Displays the computed routes graphically.
